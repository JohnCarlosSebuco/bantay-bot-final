## Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

### 1. No Real-time Data Until ESP32 Connected
**Behavior**: Dashboard shows "Connecting..." or demo values
**Expected**: App works offline, displays historical data
**Fix**: Connect to ESP32 WebSocket for live sensor data

### 2. CropHealthMonitor Shows Base UI Without sensorData
**Behavior**: Screen loads but no health assessment shown
**Expected**: Needs WebSocket connection for real-time health
**Fix**: Connect ESP32, screen will populate with live data

### 3. Analytics Shows "No Crop Data"
**Behavior**: First launch shows empty state
**Expected**: User must set up crop in HarvestPlanner first
**Fix**: Navigate to HarvestPlanner → Save crop → Analytics populate

### 4. Predictions Require Environmental Data
**Behavior**: Some predictions show "Insufficient data"
**Expected**: GDD calculations need temperature history
**Fix**: Let app collect sensor data over time (days/weeks)

### What Works ✅
- ✅ App launches successfully
- ✅ All navigation flows work
- ✅ All screens render without crashes
- ✅ All services integrated properly
- ✅ Data persistence functional
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ✅ Bilingual support working
- ✅ Empty states handled gracefully

### What Requires Hardware ⚠️
- Real-time sensor data (requires ESP32 WebSocket connection)
- Live crop health monitoring (requires sensor data)
- Bird detection alerts (requires ESP32 camera)
- Audio alerts (requires device speakers)

### User Experience 🎯
**On First Launch**:
1. App opens to Dashboard (shows connecting state)
2. Navigate to Analytics → See "No crop data" message
3. Tap to go to HarvestPlanner → Set up crop
4. Return to Analytics → See predictions and insights
5. Connect ESP32 → Real-time data populates
6. Bird detection → Logs appear in History & Analytics

**App is fully functional offline** - Uses historical data and predictions without hardware.
