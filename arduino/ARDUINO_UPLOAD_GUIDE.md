## üì∑ Part 1: Camera ESP32-CAM Upload

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect USB-to-TTL to ESP32-CAM:**
   ```
   ESP32-CAM    USB-to-TTL
   ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ    ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
   5V       ‚Üí   5V (or 3.3V)
   GND      ‚Üí   GND
   U0R (RX) ‚Üí   TX
   U0T (TX) ‚Üí   RX
   ```

2. **Enter Programming Mode:**
   - Bridge `GPIO 0` to `GND` (use jumper wire)
   - This puts ESP32-CAM into flash mode

3. **Power On:**
   - Connect USB-to-TTL to computer
   - Red LED on ESP32-CAM should light up

### Arduino IDE Configuration

1. **Select Board:**
   - Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí ESP32 Arduino ‚Üí **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**

2. **Configure Settings:**
   ```
   Board: "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM"

   Flash Mode: "QIO"
   Partition Scheme: "Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)"
   Core Debug Level: "None"
   Port: [Select your USB-to-TTL port]
   ```

3. **Update WiFi Credentials:**
   - Open `BantayBot_Camera_ESP32CAM.ino`
   - Find lines 18-19:
     ```cpp
     const char *ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
     const char *password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
     ```
   - Replace with your WiFi name and password

### Upload Process

1. **Verify Code:**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Camera Board Issues

**Problem: "Failed to connect" / Stuck on "Connecting..."**
- **Fix 1:** Ensure GPIO 0 is connected to GND before upload
- **Fix 2:** Try lowering upload speed to 115200
- **Fix 3:** Hold "BOOT" button while clicking Upload (if present)

**Problem: Camera init failed 0x105**
- **Cause:** Incorrect camera model or pin configuration
- **Fix:** Verify you selected "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM" board
- **Check:** Ensure `board_config.h` pins match your module

**Problem: Brownout detector triggered**
- **Cause:** Insufficient power supply
- **Fix:** Use powered USB hub or external 5V 2A adapter

### Main Board Issues

**Problem: DFPlayer not found**
- **Check:** RX/TX connections (swap if needed)
- **Check:** SD card is inserted and formatted as FAT32
- **Check:** MP3 files are in `/mp3/` folder on SD card
- **Test:** Connect DFPlayer to 5V directly (bypass buck converter)

**Problem: RS485 sensor returns -999**
- **Check:** A and B terminals (swap if no response)
- **Check:** RE and DE pins connected to GPIO 4
- **Check:** Baud rate is 4800 in `config.h`
- **Test:** Use USB-to-RS485 adapter to test sensor separately

**Problem: Servos jitter or don't move**
- **Check:** External 5V 3A power connected to PCA9685 V+
- **Check:** Common ground between ESP32 and servo power
- **Fix:** Add 1000¬µF capacitor across V+ and GND

**Problem: Stepper motor hums but doesn't turn**
- **Check:** Coil wiring (A1/A2, B1/B2 pairs correct)
- **Fix:** Adjust current limit potentiometer on TMC2225
- **Fix:** Check EN pin is LOW (enabled)

### WiFi Issues

**Problem: Won't connect to WiFi**
- **Check:** SSID and password spelling (case-sensitive)
- **Check:** Router is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- **Fix:** Move ESP32 closer to router
- **Fix:** Check for special characters in password (use quotes if needed)

**Problem: Keeps disconnecting**
- **Fix:** Set static IP in router settings
- **Fix:** Disable power saving: `WiFi.setSleep(false);` (already in code)

### Serial Monitor Issues

**Problem: Gibberish/garbage characters**
- **Fix:** Set baud rate to 115200
- **Fix:** Try different baud rate: 9600, 74880, 230400
- **Fix:** Check USB cable quality (data cable, not charge-only)

**Problem: No output at all**
- **Check:** Correct port selected
- **Fix:** Press RESET button on ESP32
- **Fix:** Re-upload with "Core Debug Level: Info"
